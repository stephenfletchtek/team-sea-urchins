# Welcome to our ReefRunner game!

A sidescroller game under the sea where the aim is to get the highest score possible. The longer you last in the game without being killed by a shark or being pushed of the screen by a rock of ship, the higher your score! Extra features such as bubbles make you rise up and a can of worms brings you down. Don't avoid them though as they add 1000 points to your score. Also, don't forget to catch octopus Stephen, as he will make you go twice as fast to make it easier to catch those bubbles and worms and avoid any obstacles.

This game uses Phaser as the main framework with JavaScript and HTML/CSS. Playable on both your laptop (recommended on Chrome) and phone.

**The game is deployed on Heroku:** https://reefrunner.herokuapp.com/
